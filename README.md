# Tmux Pane FontÂ Resize

This repository contains a jointly patched combination of [Alacritty](https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty) and [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) to support scaling fonts of specific tmux panes.

Here's a screenshot of it in action:

The implementation works, however it's in an experimental development stage.

Contributions are welcome.
